##What is it?

This is a [MEAN.js] (http://meanjs.org/) webapp I've made for two reasons  
  1. To practice using the MEAN.js stack  
  2. To help myself learn Korean.

It is therefore going to be very particular to my needs and studying habbits. The code will also likely be far from adhereing to the professional conventions of MEAN.js and webapp developers in general. I hope that over time the latter will improve.
